                    <p class="p-about">
                        My interest in technology began with curiosity about how things work and how magical they are, from just basic html in 
                        highschool that strengthened even more with hello world of c and some of highs school research related to AI and programming. 
                        This curiosity led me to pursue Computer Science, where I continue to challenge myself 
                        with both academic coursework and self-study in areas like calculus, physics, and programming frameworks.

                    <p class="p-about">
                        Over time, I’ve built skills in C, C++, Java, Python, SQL, and web technologies, while also exploring 
                        tools such as Git/GitHub, Flask, and Django. I enjoy creating projects that combine theory with 
                        practical applications, and I’m eager to keep expanding my knowledge to tackle real-world challenges.

                    <p class="p-about">
                        As part of my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work on a senior high school capstone
                        project that was recognized for its quality. Experiences like this motivate me to keep learning,
                        creating, improving, and finding new ways to innovate.
