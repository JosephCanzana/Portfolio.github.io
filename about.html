            <h1>About Me</h1>
        
            <p>
                My interest in technology began with curiosity about how things work and how magical they are, from just basic html in 
                highschool that strengthened even more with hello world of c and some of highs school research related to AI and programming. 
                This curiosity led me to pursue Computer Science, where I continue to challenge myself 
                with both academic coursework and self-study in areas like calculus, physics, and programming frameworks.

                Over time, I’ve built skills in C, C++, Java, Python, SQL, and web technologies, while also exploring 
                tools such as Git/GitHub, Flask, and Django. I enjoy creating projects that combine theory with 
                practical applications, and I’m eager to keep expanding my knowledge to tackle real-world challenges.
            </p>

                As part of my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work on a senior high school capstone
                project that was recognized for its quality. Experiences like this motivate me to keep learning,
                creating, improving, and finding new ways to innovate.
